Q6. JavaScript as a Backend Language

JavaScript is widely used on the backend mainly through Node.js.

1. Performance

Node.js uses a non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
This allows it to handle many requests at the same time efficiently, making it fast for real-time applications like chat apps and APIs.

2. Ecosystem

JavaScript has a huge package ecosystem through npm (Node Package Manager).
Developers can easily use libraries for:

Authentication

Database connections

File handling

Security

3. Popular Backend Frameworks

Some widely used JavaScript backend frameworks:

Express.js – Lightweight and fast for building APIs.

NestJS – Structured framework for large applications.

Fastify – High-performance server framework.
