Q5. Three-Tier Architecture

Three-Tier Architecture divides a web application into three separate layers. Each layer has a specific responsibility.

1. Presentation Layer

This is the Frontend.
It handles:

User interface

Display of data

User inputs
Example: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.

2. Application (Business) Layer

This is the Backend logic layer.
It handles:

Business rules

Request processing

Authentication and authorization
Example: Node.js, Java Spring, Python Flask.

3. Data Layer

This is the Database layer.
It handles:

Storing data

Retrieving data

Managing records
Example: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.

Why This Architecture Is Used

Separation of concerns: Each layer has a clear responsibility.

Scalability: Layers can be upgraded independently.

Maintainability: Easier to debug and modify.

Security: Database is not directly exposed to users.
