Q4. Client–Server Model

The Client–Server Model is a structure where work is divided between two sides: the client and the server.

1. Who is the Client?

The client is the user’s device or browser (Chrome, Firefox, mobile apps). It sends requests and displays responses. Example: when you click “Login,” the browser is the client.

2. Who is the Server?

The server is a computer or system that receives requests, processes them, accesses the database, and sends back the response.

3. How Communication Happens

The client sends a request (HTTP/HTTPS) to the server.

The server processes the request.

The server sends a response back to the client.

The client displays the result to the user.

Example: When you open a website, your browser requests data from the server, and the server returns the web page.
