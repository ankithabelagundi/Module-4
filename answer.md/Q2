Q2. Role of Backend (BE)

The Backend works behind the scenes. It handles data, logic, and security and ensures the application works correctly.

1. Server-Side Processing

Backend receives requests from the frontend, processes them, applies business rules, and sends back the result. For example, checking login credentials or calculating order totals.

2. Database Handling

Backend connects to databases to:

Store data (user details, orders, products)

Retrieve data

Update or delete records
It ensures data is organized and managed efficiently.

3. Security and Authentication

Backend is responsible for:

Verifying user identity (login, tokens, sessions)

Authorizing access (who can view or edit data)

Protecting sensitive data using encryption and secure APIs
This prevents unauthorized access and data leaks.
