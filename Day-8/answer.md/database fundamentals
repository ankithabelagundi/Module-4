# Database Fundamentals – Conceptual Understanding

## 1. Why is `db.json` not suitable as a database for real projects?

Using a file like `db.json` as a database may work for learning or very small applications, but it is not suitable for real-world projects due to several limitations.

### Limitations of File-Based Storage

- **Performance Issues**  
  Every read or write operation requires loading the entire file into memory. As data grows, this becomes slow and inefficient.

- **Scalability Problems**  
  File-based storage does not scale well. Handling large datasets or many users accessing the file simultaneously is difficult and unreliable.

- **Concurrency Issues**  
  Multiple users or processes trying to read and write at the same time can cause data conflicts or corruption because file locking is limited.

- **Reliability Issues**  
  If the system crashes during a write operation, the file may become corrupted, leading to data loss.

- **Lack of Advanced Features**  
  File storage does not support indexing, querying, transactions, backups, or access control, which are essential for production applications.

## 2. What are the ideal characteristics of a database system (apart from just storage)?

A good database system provides much more than simple data storage. Some important characteristics are:

### Performance
- Optimized for fast data retrieval and updates.
- Uses indexing and query optimization to reduce response time.

### Concurrency
- Allows multiple users to read and write data simultaneously without conflicts.
- Ensures data consistency even with parallel operations.

### Reliability
- Protects data from crashes, power failures, and unexpected shutdowns.
- Ensures data is not lost or corrupted.

### Data Integrity
- Enforces rules such as primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
- Prevents invalid or duplicate data from entering the system.

### Scalability
- Can handle increasing amounts of data and users.
- Supports vertical scaling (better hardware) and horizontal scaling (more servers).

### Fault Tolerance
- Automatically recovers from failures.
- Uses backups, replication, and failover mechanisms.

## 3. How many types of databases are there? What are their use cases?

Databases are broadly classified into **two main types**:

---

### 1. Relational Databases (SQL)

Relational databases store data in tables with rows and columns and use structured schemas.

**Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server

**Use Cases:**
- Banking systems (accounts, transactions)
- E-commerce applications (orders, users, payments)
- Inventory management systems
- Applications requiring complex queries and strong data consistency

**Why use them?**
- Strong data integrity
- ACID compliance
- Well-structured and predictable data

---

### 2. Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)

NoSQL databases store data in flexible formats such as documents, key-value pairs, or graphs.

**Examples:** MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Firebase

**Use Cases:**
- Social media platforms
- Real-time chat applications
- Big data and analytics
- Applications with rapidly changing or unstructured data

**Why use them?**
- High scalability
- Flexible schemas
- Better performance for large-scale distributed systems

## Conclusion

- File-based storage like `db.json` is suitable only for learning or small demos.
- Real-world applications require database systems with performance, reliability, and scalability.
- Choosing between SQL and NoSQL depends on the type of data and application requirements.
